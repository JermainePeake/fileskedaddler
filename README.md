# fileskedaddler
makes files skedaddle
filefunction is the one that works. if you run it in your CLI with python installed and running, it will move the files in the folder you designate as the src path to the dest path.
The second one is just the process I went through to create this.
still in progress.
filefunction.exe is flawed because it can't take new source and destination paths, I think I might have to implement some kind of GUI.
##edit:
please help when I run the application on another computer only a command prompt window pops up but not the tkinter gui I made. I'm not sure if its a compatability issue, a file dependency issue, or something else
