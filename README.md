makes files skedaddle
filefunction is the one that works. if you run it in your CLI with python installed and running, it will move the files in the folder you designate as the src path to the dest path.
The second one is just the process I went through to create this.
still in progress.
filefunction.exe is flawed because it can't take new source and destination paths, I think I might have to implement some kind of GUI.
